# Introduction to Databases and SQL

A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a structured way. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data, and are used in a variety of applications such as online stores, financial systems, and customer relationship management systems.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language that is used to interact with databases. SQL is used to create, modify, and query databases.

## Types of Databases

There are several types of databases, including:

- Relational databases: These are the most common type of databases, and they store data in tables with rows and columns. The tables are related to each other through keys, and data can be queried and joined across multiple tables.

- NoSQL databases: These databases are designed to handle large amounts of data that is not structured in a traditional relational way. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

- In-memory databases: These databases store data in memory, which allows for faster access and processing of data. However, the data is lost when the database is shut down.

## SQL Basics

SQL is used to create and modify databases, as well as to query and manipulate data within a database. Here are some basic SQL commands:

- `SELECT`: Used to retrieve data from a database.

- `INSERT INTO`: Used to add new rows to a table.

- `UPDATE`: Used to modify existing data in a table.

- `DELETE`: Used to delete rows from a table.

- `CREATE TABLE`: Used to create a new table in a database.

- `DROP TABLE`: Used to delete a table from a database.
